Character Deletion
In this section, you will learn how to delete characters in the Vim command mode.
To delete a character in Vim, you need to position your cursor on the character 
you are intent to delete and press x. 
Remember you need to be in the command mode! If unsure, press ESC key 
and you will enter command mode. If you are already in command mode, 
then pressing ESC again will not hurt.
