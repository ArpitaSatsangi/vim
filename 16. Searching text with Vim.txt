Navigating with Vim’s g operator is easy, but what if you do not know what line you need to edit? In this case, 
Vim allows you to search for a given keyword or phrase. 
You can use / or ? characters to search for keywords or phrases. 

/edit will search for the key word “edit” in forward direction.

In case you use ?edit, Vim will search for the key word “edit” in backward direction. 
In case your text contains multiple instances of the keyword you are searching for, 
keep pressing n key ( next ) or for backward search, use N ( SHIFT+n ) key combo.
