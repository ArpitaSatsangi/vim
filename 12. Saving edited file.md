We have already seen how to exit a file without saving changes by using the :q! Vim command. 
To save changes for a file you are editing, use :wq command in Vim command mode. 
There is also quicker way to do it, which is by key strokes SHIFT+zz.

The w command will write (save) changes
The q will quit out of Vim
The SHIFT + zz shortcut does the same thing
