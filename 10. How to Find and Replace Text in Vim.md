Finding text and replacing it with some other text is simple and straightforward in Vim. There's a one-line command that simplifies this entire process.

Here's the syntax:

:[range]s/{pattern}/{string}/[flags]
Vim command syntax to find and replace a text
Let's dismantle each part and understand how it all works.

[range] indicates that you can pass the range of lines. Pass % to find and replace in all lines. The range is separated by a comma. To find and replace between lines 5 to 10, pass 5,10. Use . to represent the current line and $ the last line of the file.
{pattern} indicates the pattern to find the text. You can pass regex patterns here.
{string} is the string to replace in the found text.  
[flags] indicates if you wish to pass any additional flags (for example, the flag c is passed to confirm before replacing the text). By default, this does a case-sensitive search. You can change it to do a case-insensitive search by passing a i flag.


1. Our sample.txt file has 2 "Hello"s. Let's replace "Hello" with "Hi" at both places.

The command to do that is:

:%s/Hello/Hi/g


%s indicates replacing the content in the entire file
Hello is the search text
Hi is the text to replace
g indicates making the change globally

2. his time, I want to change the word "Hi" (case-insensitive search) that occurs between lines 2 and 3 and replace it with "Hello and Welcome", with a confirmation to change each occurrence.

The command to do that is:

:2,3s/Hi/Hello and Welcome/gci
Vim command to change "Hi" with "Hello and Welcome" in 2nd and 3rd line.

Here's a description for each option:

y - Replace the match
n - Skip the match
a - Substitutes the match and all remaining occurrences of the match
q or Esc - Quit substitution
l - Replace the match and quit
CTRL+Y - Scroll the screen down
CTRL+E - Scroll the screen up
I want to accept the change. So, I press y. Here's the output after pressing y.
